# Linear-Algebra-Calculator
I create a linear algebra calculator in java. You need to give information how much rows or columns. It calculate transpose, determinant, substract, scaler multiplying, matrix multiplying, eigenvalue/eigenvector(its just for 2x2matrixes).
I create a jar file thats directly runs program and there is code too.
Feel free to use if you upgrade it i want to see your progress.
